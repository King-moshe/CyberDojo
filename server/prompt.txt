You are an expert backend engineer.  
Generate the server-side code step-by-step for a security-training platform called “CyberDojo”.

Tech stack:
- Node.js (TypeScript)
- Express
- MongoDB (Mongoose)

Goal:
Create a backend that manages attack scenarios, runs simulated attacks, stores logs, and exposes REST APIs.

Requirements:
1. Create the full folder structure under /server as described:
   /src
     /config (env, logger, db)
     /routes (scenarios, runs, alerts)
     /controllers
     /services
     /repositories
     /models (Scenario, Run, Alert – Mongoose schemas)
     /core/attack (AttackEngine, HttpExecutor, scenarios JSON)
     /core/detection (AlertEngine, rules)
     /middleware
     /utils
     /types
2. Generate minimal initial code files for each folder:
   - index.ts (server entry)
   - app.ts (Express setup)
   - db.ts (Mongo connection)
   - models with basic schemas
   - routes with empty handlers
   - controllers/services with placeholders
3. Use TypeScript best practices (interfaces, types, async/await).
4. No business logic yet — only scaffolding + clean architecture.
5. The output should be a complete first version of the backend skeleton ready to run.

Start now by generating:
- package.json
- tsconfig.json
- src/index.ts
- src/app.ts
- src/config/db.ts
